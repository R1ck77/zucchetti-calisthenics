# zucchetti-utils

For now a single utils to make the time computation of zucchetti
easier.

I'm going to do this as a kata, following the ruls pointed here 

https://codurance.com/2017/10/12/functional-calisthenics/

, which sums up to:

. Name everything
. No mutable state
. Exhaustive conditionals
. Do not use intermediate variables
. Expressions not statements
. No Explicit recursion
. Generic building blocks
. Side effects at the boundaries
. Infinite Sequences
. One argument functions

I'm making an exception for tests, though, which will be exempt.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Yet to be decided. It will slurp a string with a time, for now, and
spit information about the work interval, but the details are fuzzy.

    $ java -jar zucchetti-utils-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
